This is a shell script that uses an Android platform source tree (which can be downloaded) and transfers some of the java code in a "flat" structure, for example to allow debugging in Eclipse.

The only prerequisite for this script to work is to install git.

In order to use this script, type the following command:
./flatten.sh <release-tag> <android-source-dir> <destination-dir>

The value of 'release-tag' can be one of the following:
 - korg/cupcake-release
 - korg/donut-release
 - korg/eclair-release
 - korg/froyo-release
 - korg/master

The 'android-source-root' directory should point to a platform directory tree (such as one downloaded when you get all the platform folders using `repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git`) - if you don't have one, this script will automatically create the directories and download the necessary source files. (It will download a little less than 200 MiB of information - if you need multiple releases of the android source, it will be a good idea to keep that folder around until you are at least done with this script)

The 'destination' directory will be automatically created if it does not exist - files in it will be overriden.

Here is an example of use for setting the source in Eclipse for the froyo release:
./flatten.sh korg/froyo-release ~/downloads/android-source ~/android-sdk/platforms/android-8/sources
